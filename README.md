# My First Portfolio

This is the portfolio I created near the end of my full web immersive program at HackerYou in September 2018. The SVG in the header hero is a free-hand drawn illustration, create with Adobe Illustrator, of me! 

This portfolio was designed and built by me. I had originally purchased a PSD template from themeforest but did not use it, however, I took one inspiration from the theme by using a single line to connect my text to the corresponding photo in my 'Portfolio' section.
